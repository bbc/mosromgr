Before we release v1.0 and stabilise the API, we are seeking other organisations
using the MOS protocol to test *mosromgr* on their own MOS files and provide
feedback so we can integrate any necessary changes to make sure it works
effectively beyond the BBC's use.

If you can help, please test the module on your own MOS files and report back to
us using our `discussion board`_ or `issue tracker`_ on GitHub, or email us at
bbcnewslabsteam@bbc.co.uk.
